```
Seek what remains of the first
traitorous lord.
Push the lorn idol guarding their
weakness 23 times, then remain
still and wait and wait...
The first seal will be severed...
```

```

surrounded by nothing, inspect it

Seek what remains of the third
traitorous lord.
Give in to their request and bring
them peace.
The third seal will be severed...
